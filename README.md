## User Stories
This app is created for those that have a basic knowledge about wine, wine regions, production technique and would like to learn more while testing their skills.
As a user of this quiz I would like to:
- As a user, I want to quickly understand what the quiz is all about and how to start to quiz itself.
- As a user, I want to be able to play the quiz on laptop/desktop (mouse), tablet (touchscreen) and mobile (touchscreen).
- As a user, I would like to know my score as I play the game.
- As a user, I would like to get the correct answered explained when I answer incorrectly to learn more about the subject.
- As a user, I would like to have a way to share the Quiz the quiz URL with friends & family through social media(Facebook,Instagram and email).

## Strategy
The strategy is to educate people about wine knowledge, bring more enthusiasm to the subject of wine and do it in a fun and creative way. This will also be a great training tool for employees in the hospitality industry as well as those doing their Sommelier certifications.

## Wireframe
The wireframe for this project was hand written as I enjoy the artist freedom and creativity the process gives me, then those handwritten designs were digitalised with the AI-powered Uizasrd App ( app.uizard.io ).

## Excisting features
The features of the page where slightly changes from the original wireframe because of the strategy and goal of this app, to educate in a fun and creative way, and then the correct answer screens would be a distraction and make the user experience more tidious and less smooth.

The app has:
- A welcome text that is descriptive, fun/easy-going and entices the user to click the start-button.
- It has a start-button that hides the welcometext and brings out the first question with 2-4 answer options.
- When an answer is selected by touch or click the selected answer gets a extra thick border and the correct answer turns green and all the incorrect answers turns red. If you chose correctly the score-counter increases by 1, and as soon as you have selected your option a next question button will appear. (If there are no more questions available in the index a endgame/ restart button will show up)
